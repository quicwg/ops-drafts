--- abstract

This document discusses manageability of the QUIC transport protocol, focusing
on caveats impacting network operations involving QUIC traffic. Its intended
audience is network operators, as well as content providers that rely on the use
of QUIC-aware middleboxes, e.g. for load balancing.

# Introduction

QUIC {{?QUIC-TRANSPORT=I-D.ietf-quic-transport}} is a new transport protocol
encapsulated in UDP and encrypted by default. QUIC integrates TLS
{{?QUIC-TLS=I-D.ietf-quic-tls}} to encrypt all payload data and most control
information. The design focused on support of semantics for HTTP, which required
changes to HTTP known as HTTP/3 {{?QUIC-HTTP=I-D.ietf-quic-http}}.

Given that QUIC is an end-to-end transport protocol, all information in the
protocol header, even that which can be inspected, is not meant to be
mutable by the network, and is therefore integrity-protected. While less
information is visible to the network than for TCP, integrity protection can
also simplify troubleshooting, because none of the nodes on the network path
can modify the transport layer information.

This document provides guidance for network operations that manage QUIC
traffic. This includes guidance on how to interpret and utilize information that
is exposed by QUIC to the network, requirements and assumptions that the QUIC
design with respect to network treatment, and a description of how common
network management practices will be impacted by QUIC.

Since QUIC's wire image {{?WIRE-IMAGE=RFC8546}} is integrity protected and not
modifiable on path, in-network operations are not possible without terminating
the QUIC connection, for instance using a back-to-back proxy. Proxy operations
are not in scope for this document. A proxy can either explicit identify itself
as providing a proxy service, or may share the TLS credentials to authenticate
as the server and (in some cases) client acting as a front-facing instance for
the endpoint itself.

Network management is not a one-size-fits-all endeavour: practices considered
necessary or even mandatory within enterprise networks with certain compliance
requirements, for example, would be impermissible on other networks without
those requirements. This document therefore does not make any specific
recommendations as to which practices should or should not be applied; for each
practice, it describes what is and is not possible with the QUIC transport
protocol as defined.

# Features of the QUIC Wire Image {#sec-wire-image}

In this section, we discuss those aspects of the QUIC transport protocol that
have an impact on the design and operation of devices that forward QUIC packets.
Here, we are concerned primarily with the unencrypted part of QUIC's wire image
{{WIRE-IMAGE}}, which we define as the information available in the packet
header in each QUIC packet, and the dynamics of that information. Since QUIC is
a versioned protocol, the wire image of the header format can also change from
version to version. However, the field that identifies the QUIC version in some
packets, and the format of the Version Negotiation Packet, are both inspectable
and invariant {{?QUIC-INVARIANTS=I-D.ietf-quic-invariants}}.

This document describes version 1 of the QUIC protocol, whose wire image
is fully defined in {{QUIC-TRANSPORT}} and {{?QUIC-TLS}}. Features of the wire
image described herein may change in future versions of the protocol, except
when specified as an invariant {{QUIC-INVARIANTS}},
and cannot be used to identify QUIC as a protocol or
to infer the behavior of future versions of QUIC.

{{sec-google-version}} provides non-normative guidance on the identification of
QUIC version 1 packets compared to some pre-standard versions.

## QUIC Packet Header Structure {#public-header}

QUIC packets may have either a long header, or a short header. The first bit
of the QUIC header is the Header Form bit, and indicates which type of header
is present. The purpose of this bit is invariant across QUIC versions.

The long header exposes more information. It is used during connection
establishment, including version negotiation, retry, and 0-RTT data. It
contains a version number, as well as source and destination connection IDs
for grouping packets belonging to the same flow. The definition and location
of these fields in the QUIC long header are invariant for future versions of
QUIC, although future versions of QUIC may provide additional fields in the
long header {{QUIC-INVARIANTS}}.

Short headers are used after connection establishment, and contain only an
optional destination connection ID and the spin bit for RTT measurement.

The following information is exposed in QUIC packet headers:

- "fixed bit": the second most significant bit of the first octet most QUIC
  packets of the current version is currently set to 1, for endpoints to
  demultiplex with other UDP-encapsulated protocols. Even thought this bit is
  fixed in the QUICv1 specification, endpoints may use a version or extension
  that varies the bit. Therefore, observers cannot reliably use it as an
  identifier for QUIC.

- latency spin bit: the third most significant bit of first octet in the short
  packet header. The spin bit is set by endpoints such that  tracking edge
  transitions can be used to passively observe end-to-end RTT. See
  {{spin-usage}} for further details.

- header type: the long header has a 2 bit packet type field following the
  Header Form and fixed bits. Header types correspond to stages of the
  handshake; see Section 17.2 of {{QUIC-TRANSPORT}} for details.

- version number: the version number is present in the long header, and
  identifies the version used for that packet. During Version
  Negotiation (see {{version}} and Section 17.2.1 of {{QUIC-TRANSPORT}}), the
  version number field has a special value (0x00000000) that identifies the
  packet as a Version Negotiation packet. Many QUIC versions that start with
  0xff implement IETF drafts. QUIC versions that start with 0x0000 are reserved
  for IETF consensus documents. For example, QUIC version 1 uses version
  0x00000001.  Operators should expect to observe packets with other version
  numbers as a result of various internet experiments and future standards.

- source and destination connection ID: short and long packet headers carry a
  destination connection ID, a variable-length field that can be used to
  identify the connection associated with a QUIC packet, for load-balancing and
  NAT rebinding purposes; see {{sec-loadbalancing}} and {{rebinding}}. Long
  packet headers additionally carry a source connection ID. The source
  connection ID corresponds to the destination connection ID the source would
  like to have on packets sent to it, and is only present on long packet
  headers. On long header packets, the length of the connection
  IDs is also present; on short header packets, the length of the destination
  connection ID is implicit.

- length: the length of the remaining QUIC packet after the length field,
  present on long headers. This field is used to implement coalesced packets
  during the handshake (see {{coalesced}}).

- token: Initial packets may contain a token, a variable-length opaque value
  optionally sent from client to server, used for validating the client's
  address. Retry packets also contain a token, which can be used by the client
  in an Initial packet on a subsequent connection attempt. The length of the
  token is explicit in both cases.

Retry (Section 17.2.5 of {{QUIC-TRANSPORT}}) and Version Negotiation (Section
17.2.1 of {{QUIC-TRANSPORT}}) packets are not encrypted or obfuscated in any
way. For other kinds of packets, other information in the packet headers is
cryptographically obfuscated:

- packet number: All packets except Version Negotiation and
  Retry packets have an associated packet number; however, this packet number
  is encrypted, and therefore not of use to on-path observers. The offset of the
  packet number is encoded in long headers, while it
  is implicit (depending on destination connection ID length) in short headers.
  The length of the packet number is cryptographically obfuscated.

- key phase: The Key Phase bit, present in short headers, specifies the keys
  used to encrypt the packet to support key rotation. The Key Phase bit is
  cryptographically obfuscated.

## Coalesced Packets {#coalesced}

Multiple QUIC packets may be coalesced into a UDP datagram, with a datagram
carrying one or more long header packets followed by zero or one short header
packets. When packets are coalesced, the Length fields in the long headers are
used to separate QUIC packets; see Section 12.2 of {{QUIC-TRANSPORT}}.
The length header field is variable length, and its position in the header is
also variable depending on the length of the source and destination connection
ID; see Section 17.2 of {{QUIC-TRANSPORT}}.

## Use of Port Numbers

Applications that have a mapping for TCP as well as QUIC are expected to
use the same port number for both services. However, as with
TCP-based services, especially when application layer information is
encrypted, there is no guarantee that a specific application will use the
registered port, or the used port is carrying traffic belonging to the
respective registered service. For example, {{QUIC-HTTP}} specifies
the use of Alt-Svc for discovery of HTTP/3 services on other ports.

Further, as QUIC has a connection ID, it is also possible to maintain multiple
QUIC connections over one 5-tuple. However, if the connection ID is not present
in the packet header, all packets of the 5-tuple belong to the same QUIC
connection.

## The QUIC Handshake {#handshake}

New QUIC connections are established using a handshake, which is distinguishable
on the wire and contains some information that can be passively observed.

To illustrate the information visible in the QUIC wire image during the
handshake, we first show the general communication pattern visible in the UDP
datagrams containing the QUIC handshake, then examine each of the datagrams in
detail.

In the nominal case, the QUIC handshake can be recognized on the wire through at
least four datagrams we'll call "QUIC Client Hello", "QUIC Server Hello", and
"Initial Completion", and "Handshake Completion", for purposes of this
illustration, as shown in {{fig-handshake}}.

Packets in the handshake belong to three separate cryptographic and transport
contexts ("Initial", which contains observable payload, and "Handshake" and
"1-RTT", which do not). QUIC packets in separate contexts during the handshake
are generally coalesced (see {{coalesced}}) in order to reduce the number of UDP
datagrams sent during the handshake.

As shown here, the client can send 0-RTT data as soon as it has sent its Client
Hello, and the server can send 1-RTT data as soon as it has sent its Server
Hello.

{: #fig-handshake
   title="General communication pattern visible in the QUIC handshake"}

A typical handshake starts with the client sending of a QUIC Client Hello
datagram as shown in {{fig-client-hello}}, which elicits a QUIC Server Hello
datagram as shown in {{fig-server-hello}} typically containing three packets:
an Initial packet with the Server Hello, a Handshake packet with the rest of
the server's side of the TLS handshake, and initial 1-RTT data, if present.

The Initial Completion datagram contains at least one Handshake packet and
some also include an Initial packet.

Datagrams that contain a QUIC Initial Packet (Client Hello, Server Hello, and
some Initial Completion) must be at least 1200 octets long. This protects
against amplification attacks and verifies that the network path meets minimum
Maximum Transmission Unit (MTU) requirements. This is usually accomplished with
either the addition of PADDING frames to the Initial packet, or coalescing of
the Initial Packet with packets from other encryption contexts.

The content of QUIC Initial packets are encrypted using Initial Secrets, which
are derived from a per-version constant and the client's destination connection
ID; they are therefore observable by any on-path device that knows the
per-version constant. We therefore consider these as visible in our
illustration. The content of QUIC Handshake packets are encrypted using keys
established during the initial handshake exchange, and are therefore not
visible.

Initial, Handshake, and the Short Header packets transmitted after the handshake
belong to cryptographic and transport contexts. The Initial Completion
{{fig-init-complete}} and the Handshake Completion {{fig-hs-complete}} datagrams
finish these first two contexts, by sending the final acknowledgment and
finishing the transmission of CRYPTO frames.

The Client Hello datagram exposes version number, source and destination
connection IDs in the clear. Information in the TLS Client Hello frame,
including any TLS Server Name Indication (SNI) present, is obfuscated using the
Initial secret. Note that the location of PADDING is implementation-dependent,
and PADDING frames may not appear in a coalesced Initial packet.

The Initial Completion datagram does not expose any additional information;
however, recognizing it can be used to determine that a handshake has completed
(see {{sec-confirm}}), and for three-way handshake RTT estimation as in
{{sec-rtt}}.

Similar to Initial Completion, Handshake Completion also exposes no additional

completed.

When the client uses 0-RTT connection resumption, 0-RTT data may also be
seen in the QUIC Client Hello datagram, as shown in {{fig-client-hello-0rtt}}.

~~~~~
{: #fig-client-hello-0rtt
   title="Typical 0-RTT QUIC Client Hello datagram pattern"}

In a 0-RTT QUIC Client Hello datagram, the PADDING frame is only present if
necessary to increase the size of the datagram with 0RTT data to at least 1200
bytes. Additional datagrams containing only 0-RTT protected long header packets
may be sent from the client to the server after the Client Hello datagram,
containing the rest of the 0-RTT data. The amount of 0-RTT protected data is
limited by the initial congestion window, typically around 10 packets
{{?RFC6928}}.

## Integrity Protection of the Wire Image {#wire-integrity}

As soon as the cryptographic context is established, all information in the QUIC
header, including exposed information, is integrity
protected. Further, information that was sent and exposed in handshake packets
sent before the cryptographic context was established are validated later during
the cryptographic handshake.  Therefore, devices on path cannot alter any
information or bits in QUIC packet headers, except specific parts of Initial
packets, since alteration of header information  will lead to a failed integrity
check at the receiver, and can even lead to connection termination.

## Connection ID and Rebinding {#rebinding}

The connection ID in the QUIC packet headers allows routing of QUIC packets at
load balancers on other than five-tuple information, ensuring that related
flows are appropriately balanced together; and to allow rebinding of a
connection after one of the endpoint's addresses changes - usually the
client's. Client and server negotiate
connection IDs during the handshake; typically, however, only the server will
request a connection ID for the lifetime of the connection. Connection IDs for
either endpoint may change during the lifetime of a connection, with the new
connection ID being negotiated via encrypted frames. See Section 5.1 of
{{QUIC-TRANSPORT}}. Therefore, observing a new connection ID does not
necessary indicate a new connection.

Server-generated connection IDs should seek to obscure any encoding, of routing
identities or any other information. Exposing the server mapping would allow
linkage of multiple IP addresses to the same host if the server also supports
migration. Furthermore, this opens an attack vector on specific servers or
pools.

The best way to obscure an encoding is to appear random to observers, which is
most rigorously achieved with encryption. Even when encrypted, a scheme could
embed the unencrypted length of the connection ID in the connection ID itself,
instead of remembering it.

{{?QUIC_LB=I-D.ietf-quic-load-balancers}} further specified possible algorithms
to generate connection IDs at load balancers.


## Packet Numbers {#packetnumber}

The packet number field is always present in the QUIC packet header; however,
it is always encrypted. The encryption key for packet number protection on
handshake packets sent before cryptographic context establishment is specific
to the QUIC version, while packet number protection on subsequent packets uses
secrets derived from the end-to-end cryptographic context. Packet numbers are
therefore not part of the wire image that is visible to on-path observers.


## Version Negotiation and Greasing {#version}

Version Negotiation packets are not intrinsically protected, but QUIC versions
can use later encrypted messages to verify that they were authentic.
Therefore any manipulation of this list will be detected and may cause the
endpoints to terminate the connection attempt.

Also note that the list of versions in the Version Negotiation packet may
contain reserved versions. This mechanism is used to avoid ossification in the
implementation on the selection mechanism. Further, a client may send a Initial
Client packet with a reserved version number to trigger version negotiation. In
the Version Negotiation packet the connection ID and packet number of the Client
Initial packet are reflected to provide a proof of return-routability. Therefore
changing this information will also cause the connection to fail.

QUIC is expected to evolve rapidly, so new versions, both experimental and IETF
standard versions, will be deployed in the Internet more often than with
traditional Internet- and transport-layer protocols. Using a particular version
number to recognize valid QUIC traffic is likely to persistently miss a fraction
of QUIC flows and completely fail in the near future, and is therefore
not recommended. In addition, due to the speed of evolution of the protocol,
devices that attempt to distinguish QUIC traffic from non-QUIC traffic for
purposes of network admission control should admit all QUIC traffic regardless
of version.


# Network-visible Information about QUIC Flows

This section addresses the different kinds of observations and inferences that
can be made about QUIC flows by a passive observer in the network based on the
wire image in {{sec-wire-image}}. Here we assume a bidirectional observer (one
that can see packets in both directions in the sequence in which they are
carried on the wire) unless noted.


## Identifying QUIC Traffic {#sec-identifying}

The QUIC wire image is not specifically designed to be distinguishable from
other UDP traffic.

The only application binding defined by the IETF QUIC WG is HTTP/3
{{?QUIC-HTTP}} at the time of this writing; however, many other applications
are currently being defined and deployed over QUIC, so an assumption that all
QUIC traffic is HTTP/3 is not valid. HTTP over QUIC uses UDP port 443 by
default, although URLs referring to resources available over HTTP/3
may specify alternate port numbers. Simple assumptions about whether a
given flow is using QUIC based upon a UDP port number may therefore not hold;
see also {{?RFC7605}} section 5.

While the second most significant bit (0x40) of the first octet is set to
1 in most QUIC packets of the current version (see {{public-header}}),
this method of recognizing QUIC traffic is NOT RECOMMENDED. First, it only
provides one bit of information and is quite prone to collide with
UDP-based protocols other than those that this static bit is meant to allow
multiplexing with. Second, this feature of the wire image is not invariant
{{QUIC-INVARIANTS}} and may change in future versions of the protocol, or
even be negotiated during the handshake via the use of transport parameters.

Even though transport parameters transmitted in the client initial are
obserable by the network, they cannot be modified by the network without
risking connection failure. Further, the negotiated reply from the server
cannot be observed, so observers on the network cannot know which
parameters are actually in use.

### Identifying Negotiated Version

An in-network observer assuming that a set of packets belongs to a QUIC flow
can infer the version number in use by observing the handshake: an Initial
packet with a given version from a client to which a server responds with an
Initial packet with the same version implies acceptance of that version.

Negotiated version cannot be identified for flows for which a handshake is not
observed, such as in the case of connection migration; however, these flows can
be associated with flows for which a version has been identified; see
{{sec-flow-association}}.

This document focuses on QUIC Version 1, and this section applies only to
packets belonging to Version 1 QUIC flows; for purposes of on-path observation,
it assumes that these packets have been identified as such through the
observation of a version number exchange as described above.

### Rejection of Garbage Traffic {#sec-garbage}

A related question is whether a first packet of a given flow on a known
QUIC-associated port is a valid QUIC packet, to support in-network
filtering of garbage UDP packets (reflection attacks, random backscatter). While
heuristics based on the first byte of the packet (packet type) could be used to
separate valid from invalid first packet types, the deployment of such
heuristics is not recommended, as packet types may have different meanings in
future versions of the protocol.

## Connection Confirmation {#sec-confirm}

Connection establishment uses Initial and Handshake packets containing a
TLS handshake, and Retry packets that do not contain parts of the handshake.
Connection establishment can therefore be detected using heuristics similar to
those used to detect TLS over TCP. A client initiating a 0-RTT connection may
also send data packets in 0-RTT Protected packets directly after the Initial
packet containing the TLS Client Hello. Since these packets may be reordered in
the network, 0-RTT Protected data packets could be seen before the Initial
packet.

Note that clients send Initial packets before servers do, servers send Handshake
packets before clients do, and only clients send Initial packets with tokens.
Therefore, the role as a client or server can generally be confirmed by an on-
path observer. An attempted connection after Retry can be detected by
correlating the token on the Retry with the token on the subsequent Initial
packet and the destination connection ID of the new Initial packet.

## Application Identification {#sec-server}

The cleartext TLS handshake may contain Server Name Indication (SNI)
{{?RFC6066}}, by which the client reveals the name of the server it intends to
connect to, in order to allow the server to present a certificate based on
that name. It may also contain information from Application-Layer Protocol
Negotiation (ALPN) {{?RFC7301}}, by which the client exposes the names of
application-layer protocols it supports; an observer can deduce that one of
those protocols will be used if the connection continues.

Work is currently underway in the TLS working group to encrypt the SNI in TLS
1.3 {{?TLS-ESNI=I-D.ietf-tls-esni}}. This would make SNI-based application
identification impossible through passive measurement for QUIC and other
 protocols that use TLS.

### Extracting Server Name Indication (SNI) Information

If the SNI is not encrypted it can be derived from the QUIC Initial packet
by calculating the Initial Secret to decrypt the packet payload and parse the
QUIC CRYPTO Frame containing the TLS ClientHello.

As both the initial salt for the Initial Secret as well as CRYPTO frame itself
are version-specific, the first step is always to parse the version number
(second to sixth byte of the long header). Note that only long header packets
carry the version number, so it is necessary to also check the if first bit of
the QUIC packet is set to 1, indicating a long header.

Note that proprietary QUIC versions, that have been deployed before
standardization, might not set the first bit in a QUIC long header packets to
1. To parse these versions, example code is provided in the appendix (see
{{sec-google-version}}), however, it is expected that these versions will
gradually disappear over time.

When the version has been identified as QUIC version 1, the packet type needs
to be verified as an Initial packet by checking that the third and fourth bit
of the header are both set to 0. Then the client destination connection ID
needs to be extracted to calculate the Initial Secret together with the
version specific initial salt, as described in {{QUIC-TLS}}. The length of
the connection ID is indicated in the 6th byte of the header followed by the
connection ID itself.

To determine the end of the header and find the start of the payload,
the packet number length, the source connection ID length, and the token
length need to be extracted. The packet number length is defined by the seventh
and eight bits of the header as described in section 17.2. of
{{QUIC-TRANSPORT}}, but is obfuscated as described in {{QUIC-TLS}}. The source
connection ID length is specified in the byte after the destination connection
ID. And the token length, which follows the source connection ID, is a variable
length integer as specified in Section 16 of {{QUIC-TRANSPORT}}.

After decryption, the Initial Client packet can be parsed to detect the
CRYPTO frame that contains the TLS Client Hello, which then can be parsed
similarly to TLS over TCP connections. The Initial client packet may
contain other frames, so the first bytes of each frame need to be checked to
identify the frame type, and if needed skip over it. Note that the length of the
frames is dependent on the frame type. In QUIC version 1, the packet is
expected to only carry the CRYPTO frame and optionally padding frames. However,
PADDING frames, which are each one byte of zeros, may also occur before or after
the CRYPTO frame.

Note that client Initial packets after the first do not always use the
destination connection ID that was used to generate the Initial keys. Therefore,
attempts to decrypt these packets using the procedure above might fail.

## Flow Association {#sec-flow-association}

The QUIC connection ID (see {{rebinding}}) is designed to allow an on-path
device such as a load-balancer to associate two flows as identified by
five-tuple when the address and port of one of the endpoints changes; e.g. due
to NAT rebinding or server IP address migration. An observer keeping flow state
can associate a connection ID with a given flow, and can associate a known flow
with a new flow when when observing a packet sharing a connection ID and one
endpoint address (IP address and port) with the known flow.

However, since the connection ID may change multiple times during the lifetime
of a flow, and the negotiation of connection ID changes is encrypted, packets
with the same 5-tuple but different connection IDs may or may not belong to the
same connection.

The connection ID value should be treated as opaque; see {{sec-loadbalancing}}
for caveats regarding connection ID selection at servers.

## Flow teardown {#sec-teardown}

QUIC does not expose the end of a connection; the only indication to on-path
devices that a flow has ended is that packets are no longer observed. Stateful
devices on path such as NATs and firewalls must therefore use idle timeouts to
determine when to drop state for QUIC flows, see further section
{{sec-stateful}}.


## Flow Symmetry Measurement {#sec-symmetry}

QUIC explicitly exposes which side of a connection is a client and which side is
a server during the handshake. In addition, the symmetry of a flow (whether
primarily client-to-server, primarily server-to-client, or roughly
bidirectional, as input to basic traffic classification techniques) can be
inferred through the measurement of data rate in each direction. While QUIC
traffic is protected and ACKs may be padded, padding is not required.

## Round-Trip Time (RTT) Measurement {#sec-rtt}

Round-trip time of QUIC flows can be inferred by observation once per flow,
during the handshake, as in passive TCP measurement; this requires parsing of
the QUIC packet header and recognition of the handshake, as illustrated in
{{handshake}}. It can also be inferred during the flow's lifetime, if the
endpoints use the spin bit facility described below and in
{{QUIC-TRANSPORT}}, section 17.3.1.

### Measuring Initial RTT

In the common case, the delay between the Initial packet containing the TLS
Client Hello and the Handshake packet containing the TLS Server Hello
represents the RTT component on the path between the observer and the server.
The delay between the TLS Server Hello and the Handshake packet containing the
TLS Finished message sent by the client represents the RTT component on the
path between the observer and the client. While the client may send 0-RTT
Protected packets after the Initial packet during 0-RTT connection
re-establishment, these can be ignored for RTT measurement purposes.

Handshake RTT can be measured by adding the client-to-observer and
observer-to-server RTT components together. This measurement necessarily
includes any transport and application layer delay (the latter mainly
caused by the asymmetric crypto operations associated with the TLS
handshake) at both sides.

### Using the Spin Bit for Passive RTT Measurement {#spin-usage}

The spin bit provides an additional method to measure per-flow RTT from
observation points on the network path throughout the duration of a connection.
Endpoint participation in spin bit signaling is optional in QUIC. That is, while
its location is fixed in this version of QUIC, an endpoint can unilaterally
choose to not support "spinning" the bit. Use of the spin bit for RTT
measurement by devices on path is only possible when both endpoints enable it.
Some endpoints may disable use of the spin bit by default, others only in
specific deployment scenarios, e.g. for servers and clients where the RTT would
reveal the presence of a VPN or proxy. To avoid making these connections
identifiable based on the usage of the spin bit, all
endpoints randomly disable "spinning" for at least one eighth of connections,
even if otherwise enabled by default. An endpoint not participating in spin bit
signaling for a given connection can use a fixed spin value for the duration of
the connection, or can set the bit randomly on each packet sent.

When in use and a QUIC flow sends data continuously, the latency spin bit in
each direction changes value once per round-trip time (RTT). An on-path observer
can observe the time difference between edges (changes from 1 to 0 or 0 to 1) in
the spin bit signal in a single direction to measure one sample of end-to-end
RTT.

Note that this measurement, as with passive RTT measurement for TCP, includes
any transport protocol delay (e.g., delayed sending of acknowledgements) and/or
application layer delay (e.g., waiting for a response to be generated). It
therefore provides devices on path a good instantaneous estimate of the RTT as
experienced by the application. A simple linear smoothing or moving minimum
filter can be applied to the stream of RTT information to get a more stable
estimate.

However, application-limited and flow-control-limited senders can have
application and transport layer delay, respectively, that are much greater than
network RTT. When the sender is application-limited and e.g. only sends small
amount of periodic application traffic, where that period is longer than the
RTT, measuring the spin bit provides information about the application period,
not the network RTT.

Since the spin bit logic at each endpoint considers only samples from packets
that advance the largest packet number, signal generation itself is
resistant to reordering. However, reordering can cause problems at an observer
by causing spurious edge detection and therefore inaccurate (i.e., lower) RTT
estimates, if reordering occurs across a spin-bit flip in the stream.

Simple heuristics based on the observed data rate per flow or changes in the RTT
series can be used to reject bad RTT samples due to lost or reordered edges in
the spin signal, as well as application or flow control limitation; for example,
QoF {{TMA-QOF}} rejects component RTTs significantly higher than RTTs over the
history of the flow. These heuristics may use the handshake RTT as an initial
RTT estimate for a given flow. Usually such heuristics would also detect if
the spin is either constant or randomly set for a connection.

An on-path observer that can see traffic in both directions (from client to
server and from server to client) can also use the spin bit to measure
"upstream" and "downstream" component RTT; i.e, the component of the
end-to-end RTT attributable to the paths between the observer and the server
and the observer and the client, respectively. It does this by measuring the
delay between a spin edge observed in the upstream direction and that observed
in the downstream direction, and vice versa.

# Specific Network Management Tasks

In this section, we review specific network management and measurement
techniques and how QUIC's design impacts them.

## Passive Network Performance Measurement and Troubleshooting

Limited RTT measurement is possible by passive observation of QUIC traffic;
see {{sec-rtt}}. No passive measurement of loss is possible with the present
wire image. Extremely limited observation of upstream congestion may be
possible via the observation of CE markings on ECN-enabled QUIC traffic.

## Stateful Treatment of QUIC Traffic {#sec-stateful}

Stateful treatment of QUIC traffic (e.g., at a firewall or NAT middlebox) is
possible through QUIC traffic and version
identification ({{sec-identifying}}) and observation of the handshake for
connection confirmation ({{sec-confirm}}). The lack of any visible end-of-flow
signal ({{sec-teardown}}) means that this state must be purged either through
timers or through least-recently-used eviction, depending on application
requirements.

{{?RFC4787}} requires a timout that is not less than 2 minutes for most UDP
traffic.
However, in pratice, timers are often lower, in the range of 15 to 30 seconds.
In contrast, {{?RFC5382}} recommends a timeout of more than 2 hours for TCP,
given that TCP is a connection-oriented protocol with well-defined closure
semantics. For network devices that are QUIC-aware, it is recommended to also
use longer timeouts for QUIC traffic, as QUIC is connection-oriented. As such,
a handshake packet from the server indicates the willingness of the server to
communicate with the client.

The QUIC header optionally contains a connection ID which can be used as
additional entropy beyond the 5-tuple, if needed. The QUIC handshake needs
to be observed in order to understand whether the connection ID is present and
what length it has. However, connection IDs may be renegotiated during
a connection, and this renegotiation is not visible to the path. Keying state
off the connection ID may therefore cause undetectable and unrecoverable loss
of state in the middle of a connection. Use of connection ID specifically
discouraged for NAT applications.

If a NAT hits an operational limit, it is recommended to rather drop the
initial packets of a flow (see allso {{sec-filtering}}),
which potentially triggers a fallback to TCP, than using the connection ID to
muliplex mulitple connections on the same IP address port pair which risks
breakage later on connection ID change.

## Address Rewriting to Ensure Routing Stability

If the routers or switches in the server infrastructure rely on address-port
4-tuple, a NAT rebinding or any other address migration on the client side,
even if that could be handled by the QUIC server, will cause packets to be
delivered to the wrong server. In this case it seems temping to use NAT in
front of the server infrastructure to provide a stable address 4-tuple,
rather than changing the deployed routing infrastructure. As the connection
ID can change and not-yet-used values are not observable on path, this would
require servers cooperate to inform the NAT of all new connection IDs,
similarly as described in {{QUIC_LB}} for load balancers. However, this
approach is not recommended to be used with NAT functions, as hiding address
changes from a server prevents the server from validating new addresses,
which would facilitate amplification attacks (see
{{Section 9 of QUIC-TRANSPORT}}).

For example, an attacker might copy a legitimate QUIC packet and change the
source address to match its own. In the absence of a bleaching NAT, the
receiving endpoint would interpret this as a potential NAT rebinding and use a
PATH_CHALLENGE frame to prove that the peer endpoint is not truly at the new
address, thus thwarting the attack. A bleaching NAT has no means of sending an
encrypted PATH_CHALLENGE frame, so it might start redirecting all QUIC traffic
to the attacker address and thus allow an observer to break the connection.

In addition, a change of IP address or port is also an input signal to other
internal mechanisms in QUIC. When a path change is detected, path-dependent
variables like congestion control parameters will be reset protecting
the new path from overload.

## Server Cooperation with Load Balancers {#sec-loadbalancing}

In the case of content distribution networking architectures including load
balancers, the connection ID provides a way for the server to signal information
about the desired treatment of a flow to the load balancers. Guidance on
assigning connection IDs is given in
{{?QUIC-APPLICABILITY=I-D.ietf-quic-applicability}} and {{QUIC_LB}}
describes a system for coordinating selection and use of connection IDs between
load-balancers and servers.

## Filtering behavior {#sec-filtering}

{{?RFC4787}} describes possible packet filtering behaviors that relate to NATs.
Though the guidance there holds, a particularly unwise behavior is to admit a
handful of UDP packets and then make a decision as to whether or not to filter
it. QUIC applications are encouraged to fail over to TCP if early packets do
not arrive at their destination {{?I-D.ietf-quic-applicability}}, as QUIC is
based on UDP and there are known block of UDP (see Section {{sec-udp-1312}}).
Admitting a few packets allows the QUIC endpoint to determine that the path
accepts QUIC. Sudden drops afterwards will result in slow and costly timeouts
before abandoning the connection.

## UDP Policing {#sec-udp-1312}

Today, UDP is the most prevalent DDoS vector, since it is easy for compromised
non-admin applications to send a flood of large UDP packets (while with TCP the
attacker gets throttled by the congestion controller) or to craft reflection and
amplification attacks. Networks should therefore be
prepared for UDP flood attacks on ports used for QUIC traffic. One possible
response to this threat is to police UDP traffic on the network, allocating a
fixed portion of the network capacity to UDP and blocking UDP datagram over that
cap.

The recommended way to police QUIC
packets is to either drop them all or to throttle them based on the hash of the
UDP datagram's source and destination addresses, blocking a portion of the hash
space that corresponds to the fraction of UDP traffic one wishes to drop.
When the handshake is blocked, QUIC-capable applications may failover to TCP
(at least applications using well-known UDP ports). However, blindly blocking a
significant fraction of QUIC packets will allow many QUIC handshakes
to complete, preventing a TCP failover, but the connections will suffer from
severe packet loss.

## DDoS Detection and Mitigation {#sec-ddos-dec}

Current practices in detection and mitigation of Distributed Denial of Service
(DDoS) attacks generally involve classification of incoming traffic (as
packets, flows, or some other aggregate) into "good" (productive) and "bad"
(DDoS) traffic, and then differential treatment of this traffic to forward only
good traffic. This operation is often done in a separate specialized mitigation
environment through which all traffic is filtered; a generalized architecture
for separation of concerns in mitigation is given in
 {{?DOTS-ARCH=I-D.ietf-dots-architecture}}.

Key to successful DDoS mitigation is efficient classification of this traffic in
the mitigation environment.  Limited first-packet garbage detection as in
{{sec-garbage}} and stateful tracking of QUIC traffic as in {{sec-stateful}}
above may be useful during classification.

Note that the use of a connection ID to support connection migration renders
5-tuple based filtering insufficient and requires more state to be maintained by
DDoS defense systems. For the common case of NAT rebinding, DDoS defense systems
can detect a change in the client's endpoint address by linking flows based on
the server's connection IDs. QUIC's linkability resistance ensures that
a deliberate connection migration is accompanied by a change in the connection
ID.

It is questionable whether connection migrations must be supported during a DDoS
attack. If the connection migration is not visible to the network that performs
the DDoS detection, an active, migrated QUIC connection may be blocked by such a
system under attack. As soon as the connection blocking is detected by the
client, the client may rely on the fast resumption mechanism provided by
QUIC. When clients migrate to a new path, they should be prepared for the
migration to fail and attempt to reconnect quickly.

TCP syncookies {{?RFC4937}} are a well-established method of mitigating some
kinds of TCP DDoS attacks. QUIC Retry packets are the functional analogue to
syncookies, forcing clients to prove possession of their IP address before
committing server state.  However, there are safeguards in QUIC against
unsolicited injection of these packets by intermediaries who do not have consent
of the end server. See {{QUIC_LB}} for standard ways for intermediaries to send
Retry packets on behalf of consenting servers.

## Distinguishing Acknowledgment traffic

Some deployed in-network functions distinguish pure-acknowledgment (ACK) packets
from packets carrying upper-layer data in order to attempt to enhance
performance, for example by queueing ACKs differently or manipulating ACK
signaling. Distinguishing ACK packets is trivial in TCP, but not supported by
QUIC, since acknowledgment signaling is carried inside QUIC's encrypted payload,
and ACK manipulation is impossible. Specifically, heuristics attempting to
distinguish ACK-only packets from payload-carrying packets based on packet size
are likely to fail, and are not recommended to use as a way to construe
internals of QUIC's operation as those mechanisms can change, e.g., due to the
use of extensions.

## Quality of Service handling and ECMP

It is expected that any QoS handling in the network, e.g. based on use of
DiffServ Code Points (DSCPs) {{?RFC2475}} as well as Equal-Cost
Multi-Path (ECMP) routing, is applied on a per flow-basis (and not per-packet)
and as such that all packets belonging to the same QUIC connection get uniform
treatment. Using ECMP to distribute packets from a single flow across multiple
network paths or any other non-uniform treatment of packets belong to the same
connection could result in variations in order, delivery rate, and drop rate.
As feedback about loss or delay of each packet is used as input to
the congestion controller, these variations could adversely affect performance.

Depending of the loss recovery mechanism implemented, QUIC may be
more tolerant of packet re-ordering than traditional TCP traffic (see
{{packetnumber}}). However, it cannot be known by the network which exact
recovery mechanism is used and therefore reordering tolerance should be
considered as unknown.


# IANA Considerations

This document has no actions for IANA.

# Security Considerations

QUIC is an encrypted and authenticated transport. That means, once the
cryptographic handshake is complete, QUIC endpoints discard most packets that
are not authenticated, greatly limiting the ability of an attacker to interfere
with existing connections.

However, some information is still observerable, as supporting manageability of
QUIC traffic inherently involves tradeoffs with the confidentiality of QUIC's
control information; this entire document is therefore security-relevant.

More security considerations for QUIC are discussed in {{!QUIC-TRANSPORT}}
and {{!QUIC-TLS}}, generally considering active or passive attackers in the
network as well as attacks on specific QUIC mechanism.

Version Negotiation packets do not contain any mechanism to prevent version
downgrade attacks. However, future versions of QUIC that use Version Negotiation
packets are require to define a mechanism that is robust against version
downgrade attacks. Therefore a network node should not attempt to impact version
selection, as version downgrade may result in connection failure.

## Distinguishing IETF QUIC and Google QUIC Versions {#sec-google-version}

This section contains algorithms that allows parsing versions from both
Google QUIC and IETF QUIC. These mechanisms will become
irrelevant when IETF QUIC is fully deployed and Google QUIC is deprecated.

Note that other than this appendix, nothing in this document applies to
Google QUIC. And the purpose of this appendix is merely to distinguish IETF QUIC
from any versions of Google QUIC.

Conceptually, a Google QUIC version is an opaque 32bit field. When we refer to a
version with four printable characters, we use its ASCII representation:
for example, Q050 refers to \{'Q', '0', '5', '0'\} which is equal to
\{0x51, 0x30, 0x35, 0x30\}. Otherwise, we use its hexadecimal representation:
for example, 0xff00001d refers to {0xff, 0x00, 0x00, 0x1d}.

QUIC versions that start with 'Q' or 'T' followed by three digits are
Google QUIC versions. Versions up to and including 43 are documented by
<https://docs.google.com/document/d/
1WJvyZflAO2pq77yOLbp9NsGjC1CHetAXV8I0fQe-B_U/preview>.
Versions Q046, Q050, T050, and T051 are not fully documented, but this appendix
should contain enough information to allow parsing Client Hellos for those
versions.

To extract the version number itself, one needs to look at the first byte of
the QUIC packet, in other words the first byte of the UDP payload.
